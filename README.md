SETI Limits
=============================

&nbsp;


## Summary

**SETI_limits** allows you to calculate and compare of SETI Figures of Merit between multiple projects.


To compare your project values to previous surveys, all you need to do is to update the values at the start of compare_your_SETI_limits.py.
This will create the figure `SETI_limits_comparison.png`
